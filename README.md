## Prerequisite
  1. You should have docker installed on your local machine.
  2. An IDE for SQL, I personally use Dbeaver. You can add another service to the docker compose file such as PGAdmin which has a web UI.

## Setup
In this repo I'm trying to include a dev container which would potentially help develop a developer setup a local environment that is supported on all major platforms. This includes:
  1. Docker containers that run python and postgres at the moment.


## TODO
  1. Setup necessary packages on devcontainer
  2. Create a schema and tables
  3. Start the course to see if you were able to take into account the requirements.
  4. Add setup instructions.
  5. Set up .env file to handle postgres credentials and pass in the postgres uri to the python image.
  6. Continue the course for god sake SHEKHAR!!!
